###*** optimizers ***###

The primary goal of an optimizer is to adjust the model’s parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the loss function. 
The loss function measures how well the model’s predictions match the actual data.


###*** Types of optimizers ***###


1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

        Imagine you're hiking to find the lowest point in a valley, but it's foggy. 
        SGD is like taking steps in the direction that seems to go downhill the most.

        Real-world analogy: You're trying to find the shortest route to work. 
        Each day, you try a slightly different path based on yesterday's traffic. \
        Sometimes you make wrong turns, but over time, you generally find a good route.

        When to use in ML: 
        - When you have a large dataset and can afford to take your time learning
        - As a baseline to compare other optimizers against

2. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

        Adam is like a smart hiker who remembers the general direction they've been going (momentum)
        and how steep different areas have been (adaptive learning rates).

        Real-world analogy: You're shopping for the best deal on a product. 
        You remember which stores generally have good prices (momentum) and 
        you pay more attention to stores that have had big sales recently (adaptive rates).

        When to use in ML:
        - As a great starting point for most problems
        - When you're not sure which optimizer to choose
        - Especially good for problems with lots of data or parameters

3. RMSprop

        RMSprop is like a cautious hiker who takes smaller steps in areas that have been very steep or changeable,
        and larger steps in flatter, more predictable areas.

        Real-world analogy: You're learning to cook. For tricky recipes, you make small adjustments to ingredients.
        For simple recipes, you're more confident in making bigger changes.

        When to use in ML:
        - When training recurrent neural networks
        - If Adam seems to be learning too aggressively

4. Adagrad

        Adagrad is like a hiker who gets more cautious about frequently visited areas but is willing to take
        bigger steps in new territories.

        Real-world analogy: You're learning a new language. You spend more time on words you encounter often,
        making small improvements. For new words, you're willing to spend more time to learn them quickly.

        When to use in ML:
        - When dealing with sparse data (like text)
        - In problems where some features are more important than others

5. Adadelta

        Adadelta is like Adagrad, but it doesn't slow down as much over time. It's like a hiker who stays consistently cautious, not becoming overly timid.

        Real-world analogy: You're improving your photography skills. You make bigger adjustments when learning new techniques, but you also continue to make small refinements to skills you've practiced a lot.

        When to use in ML:
        - When you want the benefits of Adagrad but find it slows down too much
        - As an alternative to RMSprop or Adam

6. Adamax

        Adamax is a more stable version of Adam. It's like a hiker who is careful not to overreact 
        to very steep or unusual terrain.

        Real-world analogy: You're managing a project at work. You make changes based on feedback, 
        but you're careful not to overreact to one person's very strong opinion,
        instead considering the overall trend of feedback.

        When to use in ML:
        - When Adam is working well but seems unstable
        - In problems where you want to be more conservative about big changes

In production:

1. Start with Adam: It's a great all-rounder. In your e-commerce example, Adam would be a good choice 
for predicting customer lifetime value, as it can handle the complexity and potential sparsity of customer data.

2. If Adam is too aggressive (e.g., your model's performance is erratic), try RMSprop or SGD with momentum.

3. For natural language processing tasks, like analyzing product reviews, consider Adagrad or its variants,
as they handle sparse data well.

4. If you're working with time-series data (e.g., predicting sales trends), RMSprop or Adam are often good choices.

5. For very large datasets, like analyzing millions of transactions, SGD with a well-tuned learning rate schedule
can be very effective and computationally efficient.

Remember, the best optimizer can vary depending on your specific problem. Don't be afraid to experiment with different optimizers and see which one performs best for your particular use case.



Learning rate:
- Think of this as the step size the optimizer takes.
- A small learning rate means careful, small steps (slow learning but stable).
- A large learning rate means big steps (faster learning but might overshoot).

Momentum:
- Imagine rolling a ball down a hill. It gains speed as it goes.
- Momentum helps the optimizer move faster in consistent directions and through flat areas.

Nesterov:
- A slight tweak to momentum that looks ahead before taking a step.
- Often helps to correct the course more quickly than standard momentum.

Rho (in RMSprop and Adadelta):
- Controls how much the optimizer "remembers" about past gradients.
- Higher values (closer to 1) mean it considers more of the past.

Beta_1 and Beta_2 (in Adam):
- Beta_1 is like momentum for Adam.
- Beta_2 controls how much it adapts the learning rate for each parameter.
- Both help balance between using recent and past information.
